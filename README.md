<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Do you miss that old feeling of playing a roguelike game? If that is the case then Dungeon Crawl is the perfect choice for you. Dungen Crawl is a game developed in Java in an OOP manner.
What can you do?
You can walk through different areas of the maps that are unlocked by picking up keys and you will have to collect items such as weapons, shields, potions in order to assist you in your quest of battling the monsters of the dungeon. Be careful! If you are not paying attention you can get severely injured or burnt and you can die and start the game all over again. 
[Roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) are one of the oldest
types of video games, the earliest ones were made in the 70s, they were inspired
a lot by tabletop RPGs. Roguelikes have the following in common usually:

Here are some of the main functionalities:
* Players can move and battle with monsters on two different maps
* Players can pick up weapons or shields in order to assist them to battle the enemies of the dungeon
* Players can pick up health potions in order to heal so they don't die when fighting the monsters or going through a fire
* Players can pick up keys in order to advance through the levels
* Players can save and load games
